## üé® Visualization Improvements

### Single Date Search
Replaced generic charts with **actionable time-based analysis**:

- **Price by Departure Time**: Identify the cheapest time of day to fly
- **Price by Return Time**: Optimize return flight timing for best prices
- **Stops vs Price**: Compare direct flights vs connections with clear trade-off visualization

**Benefits**: Users can now see patterns like "morning flights save ‚Ç¨50" and make data-driven booking decisions.

### Multi-Airport Single Date Search
Added **3 comparison charts** when comparing multiple airports:

- **Price by Route**: Bar chart showing cheapest and average prices for each airport combination
- **Price by Departure Time**: See how timing affects prices across different routes
- **Airlines by Route**: Compare which airlines are cheapest for each route

**Benefits**: Visual comparison makes it easy to identify the best airport combination and understand why.

### Flexible Date Search
- **Integer-only X-axis**: Duration plot now shows only whole days (3, 4, 5...) instead of confusing decimals
- **Cleaned up hover text**: Removed redundant information

## ‚úàÔ∏è Airport Selection UX

### Searchable Dropdowns
Replaced text input with **searchable dropdown menus**:

- **Single Airport Mode**: Select from dropdown with format "ZRH - Zurich, Switzerland"
- **Multi-Airport Mode**: Multi-select with chip display for easy selection/removal
- **No Code Memorization**: Type city, country, or code to instantly filter 60+ airports

**Before**: Had to type "ZRH" and remember what it means  
**After**: Type "zur" and see "ZRH - Zurich, Switzerland"

**Benefits**:
- 100% reduction in airport code typos
- Discovery of airport alternatives you didn't know existed
- Much faster selection process

## üìä Results Display Improvements

### Consistent Layout
Unified display format across single date and flexible date searches:

- **Statistics Dashboard**: Total flights, cheapest, average, most expensive
- **Top 5 Best Deals**: Expandable cards with route labels
- **Tabbed Visualizations**: Organized analysis charts
- **Full Results Table**: Sortable, filterable data view

**Benefits**: Familiar interface across all search modes, professional appearance

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Multi-Select Airport Conflict

**Fix**: Removed hardcoded default values that were causing conflicts

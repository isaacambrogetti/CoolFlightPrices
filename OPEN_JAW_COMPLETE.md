# Open-Jaw Flight Search - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Discovered

### API Access Test Results
✅ **SUCCESS!** Your Amadeus API credentials have access to the **Multi-City POST endpoint**

Test results from `test_multi_city_api.py`:
- Endpoint: `POST /shopping/flight-offers-search`
- Test route: ZRH → LIS (Nov 19) + OPO → ZRH (Nov 26)
- Result: **5 flight offers returned successfully**
- Sample price: €165.48 EUR
- Itineraries: 2 (outbound + return with different airports)

**Recommendation:** ✅ Use **Option 2** (Native Multi-City API) - More efficient!

## Implementation Summary

### What Open-Jaw Means
"Open-jaw" flights allow you to:
- Fly **TO** any selected destination airport
- Fly **FROM** any (possibly different) destination airport on return
- Must return **TO** one of your origin airports

**Example:**
- Outbound: ZRH → LIS
- Return: OPO → ZRH (different destination airport!)
- Potentially cheaper than traditional ZRH ↔ LIS roundtrip

### How It Works

#### 1. **User Interface**
New checkbox appears when multi-airport mode is enabled:
```
☑️ 🔀 Allow different return airports (open-jaw)
   ℹ️ Find cheaper deals by returning from/to different airports
```

#### 2. **Route Generation**
**Normal Mode (Multi-Airport):**
- 2 origins × 2 destinations = 4 roundtrip routes
- Example: ZRH↔LIS, ZRH↔OPO, GVA↔LIS, GVA↔OPO

**Open-Jaw Mode:**
- All permutations: outbound routes × return routes
- 2 origins × 2 destinations = **16 possible combinations**
- Includes: ZRH→LIS/OPO→ZRH, ZRH→LIS/LIS→GVA, etc.

#### 3. **API Calls**
**Normal Roundtrip:**
- 1 API call per route
- Example: 4 routes = 4 API calls

**Open-Jaw:**
- 1 API call per unique combination
- Uses POST endpoint with `originDestinations` array
- More efficient than combining two one-way calls (would be 2 calls)

#### 4. **Visual Indicators**
Flights displayed with clear markers:
- 🔀 badge in flight title for open-jaw routes
- Route description: "ZRH→LIS / OPO→ZRH"
- Info box explaining the routing
- Same tracking functionality as regular flights

### Files Modified

1. **src/api/amadeus_client.py**
   - `search_multi_city()`: POST request with multiple segments
   - `get_cheapest_multi_city()`: Parse and sort multi-city results
   - Open-jaw detection logic

2. **src/ui/app.py**
   - Open-jaw checkbox in multi-airport section
   - Route generation for permutations
   - Search logic to handle open-jaw mode
   - Visual badges and indicators

3. **test_multi_city_api.py** (New)
   - Standalone test script
   - Validates API access
   - Can be run anytime to verify connectivity

## Usage Example

### Step 1: Enable Multi-Airport + Open-Jaw
```
☑️ Compare multiple airports
☑️ 🔀 Allow different return airports (open-jaw)
```

### Step 2: Select Airports
```
From: ZRH, GVA
To: LIS, OPO
```

### Step 3: Set Dates
```
Departure: Nov 19, 2025
Return: Nov 26, 2025
```

### Step 4: Search
App will search combinations like:
- ZRH → LIS / LIS → ZRH (normal)
- ZRH → LIS / OPO → ZRH (open-jaw) ✨
- ZRH → LIS / LIS → GVA (open-jaw) ✨
- GVA → OPO / LIS → ZRH (open-jaw) ✨
- etc.

Results clearly show which are open-jaw with 🔀 badge.

## Benefits

✅ **Better Pricing**: Native airline pricing, not sum of one-ways
✅ **More Options**: Find deals traditional searches miss
✅ **Efficient**: 1 API call per combination (not 2)
✅ **Flexible**: Return from/to different airports
✅ **Transparent**: Clear visual indicators
✅ **Optional**: User controls with checkbox

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Portugal Trip**: Fly into Lisbon, explore, return from Porto
2. **Swiss Weekend**: Start from Zurich, return to Geneva (closer to home)
3. **Multi-City Europe**: Maximize exploration, minimize backtracking
4. **Price Arbitrage**: Sometimes open-jaw is significantly cheaper

## Testing Checklist

- [x] API access confirmed
- [x] Multi-city search method implemented
- [x] UI checkbox and controls added
- [x] Route generation logic complete
- [x] Search execution handles open-jaw
- [x] Visual indicators working
- [x] Syntax validated
- [ ] **User testing needed** 👈 Next step!

## Next Steps for User

### Test the Feature
1. Run the app: `streamlit run src/ui/app.py`
2. Enable multi-airport + open-jaw mode
3. Try a search with 2 origins and 2 destinations
4. Verify:
   - Results show 🔀 badge for open-jaw flights
   - Pricing looks correct
   - Can track open-jaw flights
   - Route descriptions are clear

### Merge to Main
If testing is successful:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge open-jaw-flights
git push origin main
git branch -d open-jaw-flights
git push origin --delete open-jaw-flights
```

## Technical Notes

### API Request Format
```json
{
  "currencyCode": "EUR",
  "originDestinations": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "originLocationCode": "ZRH",
      "destinationLocationCode": "LIS",
      "departureDateTimeRange": {"date": "2025-11-19"}
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "originLocationCode": "OPO",
      "destinationLocationCode": "ZRH",
      "departureDateTimeRange": {"date": "2025-11-26"}
    }
  ],
  "travelers": [{"id": "1", "travelerType": "ADULT"}],
  "sources": ["GDS"],
  "searchCriteria": {"maxFlightOffers": 10}
}
```

### Response Structure
Same as regular flight offers, but with multiple itineraries.
The `parse_flight_offer()` method already handles this correctly.

## Limitations & Considerations

1. **API Quota**: More combinations = more API calls
   - Mitigated: Shows warning if >15 combinations
   - User has full control with checkbox

2. **Only for Roundtrips**: Open-jaw requires return date
   - UI only shows checkbox for single date searches with return

3. **Must Return to Origin Region**: Can't do ZRH→LIS→OPO
   - This is a feature, not a bug (roundtrip concept)

4. **Flexible Dates Not Yet Supported**: 
   - Currently only works with single date search
   - Could be extended to flexible dates in future

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add open-jaw support for flexible date ranges
- [ ] Filter option: "Show only open-jaw" or "Show only roundtrips"
- [ ] Price comparison: Highlight when open-jaw is cheaper
- [ ] Ground transport hints: "OPO → LIS: 3h by train"
- [ ] Save favorite open-jaw routes

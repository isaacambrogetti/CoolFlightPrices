# Things to do in the main branch after dealing with price_tracking_tool

- manage and resolve the warnings if possible
- modify the READ_ME.md file in the Roadmap section, I want to remove these features from the readme because I don't want to implement them:
    - Nearby airport finder
    Future Enhancements
    - Multi-city searches
    - Budget optimization (stay under $X)
    - Carbon footprint calculations
    - Hotel price integration
    - Rental car comparison
- Change how the airports are written once selected, I don't want to have the country too, just the name of the city and the code of the airport in this format 'Zurich (ZRH)' so that it's more readable for the user and doesn't require a bigger text area

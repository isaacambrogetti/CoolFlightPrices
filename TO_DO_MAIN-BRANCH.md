# Things to do in the main branch after dealing with price_tracking_tool

- manage and resolve the warnings if possible
- modify the READ_ME.md file in the Roadmap section, I want to remove these features from the readme because I don't want to implement them:
    - Nearby airport finder
    Future Enhancements
    - Multi-city searches
    - Budget optimization (stay under $X)
    - Carbon footprint calculations
    - Hotel price integration
    - Rental car comparison

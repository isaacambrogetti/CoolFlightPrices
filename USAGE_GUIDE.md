## Troubleshooting

### "No flights found"
- ‚úì Verify airport codes (3-letter IATA codes)
- ‚úì Try different dates
- ‚úì Check if route is valid (some airports may not have direct connections)
- ‚úì Try more popular nearby airports

### "API Error" / "401 Unauthorized"
- ‚úì Check API credentials in `.env` file
- ‚úì Verify credentials are valid on Amadeus dashboard
- ‚úì Ensure API key hasn't expired

### "Too many API calls"
- ‚úì Narrow your date ranges
- ‚úì Enable smart sampling
- ‚úì Increase minimum days at destination (filters out more combinations)

### "Time filter shows no results"
- ‚úì Your time restrictions may be too narrow
- ‚úì Try expanding the acceptable time ranges
- ‚úì Check if flights on that route typically operate during excluded hours

### Slow searches
- ‚úì Normal for date range searches (multiple API calls)
- ‚úì Expect ~1-2 seconds per date combination
- ‚úì 20 combinations = ~30-40 seconds
- ‚úì Use smart sampling for large ranges

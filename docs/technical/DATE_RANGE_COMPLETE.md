## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. Start the App

```bash
cd /Users/isaac/Documents/Progettini/CoolFlightPrices
source .venv/bin/activate
streamlit run src/ui/app.py
```

### 2. Select "Flexible Dates" Mode

In the sidebar, choose: **"💡 Flexible Dates (Date Range)"**

### 3. Set Your Parameters

**Departure Range:**
- Earliest: Nov 10, 2025
- Latest: Nov 14, 2025
(5 departure options)

**Return Range:**
- Earliest: Nov 20, 2025
- Latest: Nov 24, 2025
(5 return options)

**Minimum Days at Destination:** 3 days
(Ensures you have at least 3 full days there)

This gives you: 5 × 5 = 25 valid combinations to compare!

### 4. Click "Search Date Range"

The app will:
- Show progress as it searches each combination
- Display a progress bar
- Update status (e.g., "Searching Nov 10 → Nov 20 (15/25)")

### 5. View Results

**Statistics Dashboard:**
- Total searches performed
- How many found flights
- Cheapest price
- Average price

**Best Deals:**
- Top 5 cheapest options
- Full trip details
- Flight information

**Visualizations (4 tabs):**
1. **Price Heatmap** - See all prices at once (green=cheap, red=expensive)
2. **Distribution** - Histogram showing price spread
3. **Duration vs Price** - Does longer stay = higher price?
4. **Calendar View** - Best price for each departure date

### 6. Example Use Case

**Scenario:** Weekend trip to Lisbon
- You can leave: Thu Nov 13 - Sat Nov 15
- You can return: Sun Nov 23 - Tue Nov 25
- You want at least 1 week there

**Result:** App finds the cheapest combination automatically!
- Maybe leaving Friday and returning Monday is €50 cheaper than Saturday-Sunday!

## 💡 Smart Features Explained

### Minimum Days at Destination

This filter ensures you have enough full days at your destination:

```
Example: Nov 10 departure → Nov 13 return
- Nov 10: Travel day (doesn't count)
- Nov 11: Full day ✓
- Nov 12: Full day ✓
- Nov 13: Travel day (doesn't count)
= 2 full days at destination
```

If you set "Minimum: 3 days", this combination would be filtered out.

### Smart Sampling

When you have a large date range (e.g., entire month), the app can sample intelligently:

**Without sampling:** 30 departure dates × 30 return dates = 900 API calls! 💸

**With sampling:** Picks evenly distributed dates = ~30 API calls 💰

The algorithm:
- Always includes first and last dates
- Samples evenly in between
- Still respects minimum stay requirement
- Gives you excellent coverage with 95%+ fewer API calls

## 📊 Visualizations Explained

### 1. Price Heatmap
```
          Return Date
          20   21   22   23
Dep  10  €162 €175 €180 €190
     11  €158 €165 €172 €185  ← Cheapest row
     12  €170 €172 €178 €195
     
Quickly spot: Leaving Nov 11, returning Nov 20 = Best deal!
```

### 2. Price Distribution
Shows how prices are distributed:
- Most flights: €150-180
- Some outliers: €200+
- Sweet spot visible at a glance

### 3. Duration vs Price
See correlation:
- Do longer trips cost more?
- Find value: 7-day trip same price as 5-day!

### 4. Calendar View
Bar chart showing best price for each departure day:
- See which days are cheapest to leave
- Weekend vs weekday patterns
- Quick visual comparison

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### API Efficiency

**Free tier:** 2,000 calls/month = ~66/day

**Date range search:**
- Small (5×5): 25 calls
- Medium (7×7): 49 calls
- Large (10×10): 100 calls (use sampling!)

**Smart sampling:**
- Large (30×30): 900 calls → 30 calls (97% savings!)

### Performance

- Progress tracking for all searches
- Rate limiting respects API quotas
- Error handling per date combination
- Results cached during session
- Interactive charts load instantly

## 🎓 Tips & Best Practices

### Start Small
- First search: Try 3-5 days for each range
- Get familiar with the interface
- Then expand to larger ranges

### Use Smart Sampling
- Enable for ranges >50 combinations
- Still gives excellent results
- Saves your API quota

### Interpret the Heatmap
- Green zones = Best deals
- Red zones = Avoid if possible
- Look for patterns (weekday vs weekend)

### Minimum Days Strategy
- Weekend trip: min 1-2 days
- Week trip: min 5 days
- Vacation: min 7 days
- Filters out impractical short connections

### API Quota Management
- Check combinations count before searching
- Use sampling for exploration
- Do detailed search once you narrow down
- Each search cached during session

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Too many combinations"
- Reduce date ranges
- Increase minimum days requirement
- Enable smart sampling
- Maximum allowed: 100 combinations

### "No flights found"
- Try different airports
- Adjust date ranges
- Lower minimum days requirement
- Check if dates are too far in future

### Slow search
- Normal for 30+ combinations
- Watch progress bar
- Each combination = ~1-2 seconds
- Consider sampling for faster results

### Charts not showing
- Need at least 3-4 successful searches
- Check if any flights were found
- Try different date ranges
- Some visualizations need minimum data

## 🚀 What's Next?

Now that you have this powerful feature, you can add:

### Phase 2 Enhancements:
- **Save searches**: Store and recall your favorite searches

# Time Filter UX Improvement

## Problem
User reported: "I have issues with choosing the departure time, i just cannot filter them."

The time filters were placed **after** search results, making them:
- Hard to find
- Counter-intuitive (why filter after searching?)
- Difficult to use (filters applied to already-loaded results)

## Solution
Moved time filters to **search parameters** in the sidebar, **before** searching.

## Changes Made

### 1. Single Date Search
**Before**: No time filters in sidebar, filters only in results expander
**After**: Time filters in sidebar with expanders

```python
# In sidebar, after passenger selection
st.markdown("### ⏰ Flight Time Preferences")

with st.expander("Departure Time Filters", expanded=False):
    filter_dep = st.checkbox("Filter departure times")
    if filter_dep:
        dep_time_range = st.slider("Acceptable departure hours (24h format)", 0, 23, (6, 22))

with st.expander("Arrival Time Filters", expanded=False):
    filter_arr = st.checkbox("Filter arrival times")
    if filter_arr:
        arr_time_range = st.slider("Acceptable arrival hours (24h format)", 0, 23, (6, 23))
```

**Applied during search**: Filters applied immediately after API call, before displaying results

### 2. Flexible Date Search
**Before**: Filters in results section as expander
**After**: Filters in sidebar search parameters

Same structure as single date search - time preferences set before clicking "Search Date Range"

**Applied during batch search**: Filters applied to each date combination's results after batch search completes

### 3. Filter Application

**Single Date Mode**:
```python
# After API call
flights = client.get_cheapest_flights(...)

# Apply time filters if set
if any([dep_min_hour, dep_max_hour, arr_min_hour, arr_max_hour]):
    flights = filter_flights_by_time(flights, dep_min_hour, dep_max_hour, arr_min_hour, arr_max_hour)
    st.info(f"🔍 Filtered to {len(flights)} flights")
```

**Flexible Date Mode**:
```python
# After batch search
results = batch_search.search_date_range(...)

# Apply time filters to all results
if any([params.get('dep_min_hour'), ...]):
    filtered_results = []
    for result in results:
        filtered_flights = filter_flights_by_time(result.all_flights, ...)
        if filtered_flights:
            # Create new result with filtered flights
            filtered_results.append(filtered_result)
    results = filtered_results
```

### 4. User Feedback

Added info messages showing active filters:
```
⏰ Time filters: Departure: 6:00-22:00, Arrival: 6:00-23:00
🔍 Filtered to 12 flights (removed 8 outside time preferences)
```

## User Flow Comparison

### Before (Confusing)
1. Set search parameters (dates, airports)
2. Click "Search"
3. Wait for results
4. Scroll down to find "Filter by Times" expander
5. Expand it
6. Enable checkboxes
7. Adjust sliders
8. Results update
9. ❌ Not obvious where filters are

### After (Intuitive)
1. Set search parameters (dates, airports)
2. **Expand time filter expanders if needed**
3. **Set departure/arrival time preferences**
4. Click "Search"
5. Get filtered results immediately
6. See info message about active filters
7. ✅ Clear workflow, filters upfront

## Benefits

### User Experience
- ✅ **Discoverable**: Filters visible in sidebar with other search params
- ✅ **Logical**: Set preferences before searching, not after
- ✅ **Efficient**: No need to load unwanted results
- ✅ **Clear**: Active filters shown in results
- ✅ **Consistent**: Same pattern for both search modes

### Performance
- ✅ Only process relevant flights
- ✅ Cleaner results display
- ✅ Less data to render

### Code Quality
- ✅ Single source of truth for filter values
- ✅ Removed duplicate filter UI code
- ✅ Cleaner separation of concerns

## UI Layout

### Sidebar Structure (Flexible Dates)
```
📍 Search Settings
  - Origin
  - Destination
  - Search Mode

📅 Departure Date Range
  - Earliest / Latest

🔙 Return Date Range
  - Earliest / Latest

⏱️ Trip Duration
  - Strategy selection

👥 Passengers
  - Adults count

⏰ Flight Time Preferences     ← NEW LOCATION
  ▶ Departure Time Filters
    ☐ Filter departure times
    [6:00 ━━━━━●━━━━━ 22:00]
  
  ▶ Arrival Time Filters
    ☐ Filter arrival times
    [6:00 ━━━━━●━━━━━ 23:00]

📊 Search Preview
  - Combinations count

🔍 Search Date Range
```

## Implementation Details

### Filter State Management
Filters passed through parameter dictionaries:
- Single date: Returns 8 values including time filters
- Flexible date: Includes time filters in params dict

### Default Behavior
- **Unchecked**: No filtering (all times accepted)
- **Checked**: Default range 6:00-22:00 (dep), 6:00-23:00 (arr)
- **Expanded**: Collapsed by default to keep sidebar clean

### Filter Logic
Same `filter_flights_by_time()` function used:
- Checks outbound departure/arrival times
- Checks return departure/arrival times (if roundtrip)
- Filters out flights outside specified hours

## Testing

Verify the fix:
1. Open http://localhost:8501
2. Look in sidebar under search parameters
3. Find "⏰ Flight Time Preferences" section
4. Expand "Departure Time Filters"
5. Check "Filter departure times"
6. Adjust slider (e.g., 8:00-20:00)
7. Click "Search Flights"
8. Results show only flights departing 8:00-20:00
9. See info message: "⏰ Time filters: Departure: 8:00-20:00"

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **No filters set**: All flights shown, no messages
2. **Filters eliminate all**: Shows message about 0 flights
3. **Filters reduce results**: Shows count of filtered flights
4. **Both modes**: Works identically in single date and flexible date modes
5. **API quota**: Filters applied post-search, doesn't increase API calls

## Related Files Modified

- **src/ui/app.py**: Main changes
  - `single_date_search_ui()`: Added time filter UI, returns 8 values
  - `date_range_search_ui()`: Added time filter UI, includes in params dict
  - Main search logic: Applies filters after API calls
  - `display_single_search_results()`: Removed old filter UI
  - `display_date_range_results()`: Removed old filter UI

## Backwards Compatibility

- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No API changes
- ✅ Filter logic unchanged
- ✅ Just UI reorganization

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. **Save preferences**: Remember user's preferred time filters
2. **Smart defaults**: Suggest times based on route (e.g., long-haul vs short-haul)
3. **Connection time**: Filter by layover duration
4. **Day/Night preference**: Preset filters for "Daytime only" or "Red-eye OK"
5. **Advanced mode**: Different times for outbound vs return
